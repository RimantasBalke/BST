Binary Search Tree:

•	Implement above mentioned data structure without using specific libraries for it. Let it be a simple console app;
•	You can use any language;
•	Things code should be able to do:
	o	Create BST -  Mandatory;
	o	Insert node -  Mandatory;
	o	Delete node – Mandatory;
	o	Traverse tree from left to right/ Traverse tree from right to left -  – At least in one direction; 
	o	Update node value – Mandatory;
	o	Delete BST – Mandatory;
	o	Balance BST (after every operation – inserting, deleting) – big ups if implementation of this one is done ;) ;
•	Write some code for testing your work (preferably with huge amount of nodes) – Mandatory;
